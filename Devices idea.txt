Device 1: A pen-like instrument featuring a 2 cm thin hollow tube with a mini umbrella-like structure that can be manually deployed using a rotating mechanism connected to mini gears. Once the umbrella makes contact with the cervix (detected by sensors), it stops expanding, allowing precise measurement of the dilation. The device has been fully simulated using Fusion 360. We have aimed to make it non-invasive, offering a painless and optimal method for accurate dilation measurement, and can further enhance it by selecting the optimal, non-reactive materials to ensure patient safety and comfort.

Device 2: This device follows non-invasive technique and provides real-time visualization of cervical dilation. We developed a working prototype and successfully tested it on cervical images from Google. By integrating a laparoscope with machine learning, the device is capable of detecting and measuring dilation using an algorithm that identifies circular shapes, calculates their radius, and determines dilation by doubling the radius.


We propose a dual approach to cervical dilation measurement that integrates a mechanical cervical measuring system and an advanced endoscopic camera equipped with AI and machine learning capabilities. The mechanical system features an innovative inverted umbrella structure that expands upon emerging from a guide tube, allowing for precise measurement of cervical dilation in increments of 1 cm. The use of cost-effective materials and straightforward mechanical components keeps the system low-cost and affordable, making it accessible for various healthcare settings. Integrated sensors on the umbrella’s probes detect contact with the cervical wall, sending signals that enable healthcare providers to apply the Pythagorean theorem for accurate radius calculations. This design is minimally invasive, ensuring patient comfort while delivering real-time data to facilitate timely decision-making during labor.

Complementing the mechanical system, the endoscopic camera solution provides high-resolution imaging of the cervix, enabling continuous monitoring of cervical changes during pregnancy. By leveraging AI and machine learning algorithms, the camera analyzes visual data to identify abnormalities and assess dilation, enhancing diagnosis and treatment plans. This innovative sensor technology not only improves accuracy but also reduces the need for more invasive procedures, positioning our solution as technically feasible and appealing in today’s market. With a growing emphasis on patient-centered care and safety, the potential for widespread adoption is significant. Moreover, the modular design of both systems allows for scalability; healthcare providers can easily integrate additional features or adapt them to different clinical environments, ensuring that our solution can evolve with the changing needs of the healthcare industry.
