# ü§∞ CerviArc: Advanced Cervical Dilation Measurement System

## üåü Project Goal
[cite_start]CerviArc is an innovative medical device designed to **accurately and objectively measure cervical dilation**[cite: 236]. [cite_start]The primary objective is to standardize labor assessment and enhance the safety and effectiveness of childbirth management, overcoming the subjectivity of the current method, the digital vaginal examination[cite: 236, 248].

## üõ†Ô∏è System Components and Technology

The device integrates a mechanical design with a novel pressure sensor and advanced signal processing.

### 1. Mechanical Structure: Layered Hollow Cylinder

[cite_start]The main structure is a multi-layered hollow cylinder designed for durability and comfort[cite: 288].

| Layer | Material | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Outer** | Medical-Grade Silicone | [cite_start]Superior comfort, pliability, and high **biocompatibility**[cite: 289]. |
| **Middle** | Polyurethane (PU) | [cite_start]Added support and durability; maintains flexibility and resists deformation during umbrella expansion[cite: 289]. |
| **Inner** | PEEK or UHMWPE | [cite_start]Structural backbone providing **mechanical strength** and resistance to internal pressure[cite: 289]. |

### 2. Novel Pressure Sensing

[cite_start]The core of the measurement is an innovative sensor concept for continuous pressure monitoring[cite: 301, 302, 333].

| Component | Working Principle |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Deformable Sphere** | [cite_start]A hollow, biocompatible sphere that deforms when the cervical wall exerts pressure on it[cite: 304, 305, 323]. |
| **Quartz Crystal** | [cite_start]Embedded within the sphere, the compression generates an electrical signal due to the **piezoelectric effect**[cite: 306, 307, 326, 327]. |

### 3. Instrumentation and Filtering

[cite_start]The small electrical signal from the quartz crystal is processed to ensure accuracy[cite: 363].

* [cite_start]**Signal Amplification:** An **instrumentation amplifier** boosts the weak sensor signals to measurable levels, ensuring even minor changes in dilation are detected[cite: 367, 429, 433].
* [cite_start]**Noise Reduction:** A **Chebyshev 4th Order Filter** is used to remove high-frequency electrical interference, providing a cleaner signal for accurate real-time measurements[cite: 373, 441, 444, 446].
* [cite_start]**Digital Conversion:** Analog-to-digital conversion prepares the data for processing by a microcontroller[cite: 374, 375].
