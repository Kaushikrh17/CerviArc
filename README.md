## üõ†Ô∏è System Components and Technology

The device integrates a mechanical design with a novel pressure sensor and advanced signal processing.

### 1. Mechanical Structure: Layered Hollow Cylinder

The main structure is a multi-layered hollow cylinder designed for durability and comfort.

| Layer | Material | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Outer** | Medical-Grade Silicone | Superior comfort, pliability, and high **biocompatibility**. |
| **Middle** | Polyurethane (PU) | Added support and durability; maintains flexibility and resists deformation during umbrella expansion. |
| **Inner** | PEEK or UHMWPE | Structural backbone providing **mechanical strength** and resistance to internal pressure. |

### 2. Novel Pressure Sensing

The core of the measurement is an innovative sensor concept for continuous pressure monitoring.

| Component | Working Principle |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Deformable Sphere** | A hollow, biocompatible sphere that deforms when the cervical wall exerts pressure on it. |
| **Quartz Crystal** | Embedded within the sphere, the compression generates an electrical signal due to the **piezoelectric effect**. |

### 3. Instrumentation and Filtering

The small electrical signal from the quartz crystal is processed to ensure accuracy.

* **Signal Amplification:** An **instrumentation amplifier** boosts the weak sensor signals to measurable levels, ensuring even minor changes in dilation are detected.
* **Noise Reduction:** A **Chebyshev 4th Order Filter** is used to remove high-frequency electrical interference, providing a cleaner signal for accurate real-time measurements.
* **Digital Conversion:** Analog-to-digital conversion prepares the data for processing by a microcontroller.
